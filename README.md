# datamining2-human-activity-recognition
My second Data Mining project (2022).

The dataset from which our work is developed was born from a collaboration between the University of Genoa and the Polytechnic of Barcelona. Through the help of motion sensors incorporated into smartphones (Samsung Galaxy S II), specifically gyroscope and accelerometer, the movement signals of 30 volunteers were noted, performing six different activities. Hence the six movement classes that label the dataset: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.
Different Data Mining and ML techniques have been treated and consequently different approaches have been applied from time to time on the data to better prepare the dataset for a specific task.
